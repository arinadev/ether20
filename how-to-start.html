                                        <li>By now you should have an account selected in the account dropdown (upper right). Your account should be managed by either MetaMask, EtherDelta's browser wallet, or Parity.</li>
                                        <li>In the account dropdown (upper right), next to your account address is your wallet balance. If it's 0, you need to send some ETH to your wallet address. Do that before proceeding to the next step.</li>
                                        <li>Now that you have some ETH in your wallet, you need to deposit from your wallet to the EtherDelta smart contract so that you can start trading.</li>
                                        <li>In the upper left, there is a Balance panel. There are three columns, "Token," "Wallet," and "EtherDelta." The first column, "Token," will have a row for the token you're looking at and a row for ETH. The "Wallet" column shows the balance held in the account you have selected in the account dropdown. Notice that the balance shown in the ETH row under "Wallet" matches the balance shown in the account dropdown.</li>
                                        <li>When you deposit, you will move funds from your "Wallet" to the EtherDelta exchange smart contract. To do this, enter the amount you want to deposit and press "Deposit." Don't deposit all of your ETH though. You need to leave some behind in your "Wallet" to cover gas fees. A good rule of thumb is to leave 0.05 ETH in your "Wallet" to cover gas fees for future transactions you will do (trading, depositing, withdrawing).</li>
                                        <li>After you press the "Deposit" button, if you're using MetaMask you'll have a transaction to approve. You can reduce the gas price from the default (~21 gwei) to 4 gwei if you're willing to wait longer for your transaction to confirm but pay a lower fee. If you're not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the "Gas price" item in the account dropdown (upper right).</li>
                                        <li>NOTE: If you are depositing a token (not ETH), depositing will involve two back-to-back transactions. The first one approves the EtherDelta smart contract to transfer the deposit on your behalf. The second one is the actual deposit. You must approve both.</li>
                                        <li>After your transaction has been sent, EtherDelta will tell you that you generated a transaction. You can click the link to track your transaction on Etherscan.</li>
                                        <li>Once your transaction confirms, you should see funds move from the "Wallet" column to the "EtherDelta" column.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Withdraw</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The Withdraw tab is the opposite of the Deposit tab. It will move funds from the "EtherDelta" column back to the "Wallet" column.</li>
                                        <li>Remember that in order to withdraw, you need to pay a gas fee, and the gas fee comes from your "Wallet."</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Transfer</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>If you find yourself asking, "what if I want to move my funds to another Ethereum address?" then the Transfer tab is for you. The Deposit tab moves funds from your wallet to EtherDelta. The Withdraw tab moves funds from EtherDelta to your wallet. The Transfer tab moves funds from your wallet to another wallet address.</li>
                                        <li>If you want to "withdraw to another Ethereum address," you need to withdraw and then transfer.</li>
                                        <li>On the Transfer tab, the first box is the amount you want to transfer. The second box is the address you want to transfer to. By default, the address you want to transfer to is pre-filled in with your existing address. Overwrite this with another address of your choice and then press "Transfer."</li>

                                    <h2>How to trade</h2>

                                    <p>This guide assumes you already have a working account and you have deposited to EtherDelta. This means you should have a balance in the "EtherDelta" column. You should also have some ETH in the "Wallet" column to pay for gas fees when you trade.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Pick a token to trade. This guide will assume you have chosen PLU.</li>
                                        <li>Most tokens are listed in terms of ETH. For example, a price of 0.03 PLU/ETH means 1 PLU costs 0.03 ETH.</li>
                                        <li>In the order book, there are green orders and red orders stacked on top of each other. Green orders are people who want to buy PLU. Red orders are people who want to sell PLU. If you want to buy PLU, you can click a red order. If you want to sell PLU, you can click a green order.</li>
                                        <li>EtherDelta only allows you to match against one order per transaction. You can't do a "market buy" that trades against multiple orders at once.</li>
                                        <li>Partial fills are allowed. For example, if there is an order to sell 100 PLU, you can click the order and choose to only trade 25 PLU, leaving 75 PLU behind for someone else to trade.</li>
                                        <li>When you do a trade, a transaction will be generated.</li>
                                        <li>If two people try to trade the same order at once, the first transaction to be confirmed will get the trade (unless both orders are partial fills).</li>
                                        <li>A failed trade will show up as an error on Etherscan. No funds will be lost except the gas fee for the transaction.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <b>How to place an order</b>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>If you don't want to trade immediately or don't like the prices you see in the order book, you can place your own order.</li>
                                        <li>An order doesn't involve a transaction. It involves signing a message. This means there is no gas fee for placing an order.</li>
                                        <li>On the order form, select the Buy tab or the Sell tab depending on whether you want to buy or sell the token.</li>
                                        <li>Let's assume you want to buy PLU.</li>
                                        <li>The first box is the amount of PLU you want to buy.</li>
                                        <li>The second box is the PLU/ETH price.</li>
                                        <li>The third box is the amount of ETH you will spend. This box will populate automatically so you can confirm that the price you entered makes sense.</li>
                                        <li>The fourth box is the number of Ethereum blocks until your order automatically expires. The default, 10,000, is about two days. If you want your order to last forever, enter 1000000000, which corresponds to about 400 years.</li>
                                        <li>After you submit the order, you should see two small green bubbles pop up in the lower right. The first one will say "You sent an order." The second one will say "Your order was received."</li>
                                        <li>After your order was received, it can take about a minute for the order to appear in the order book.</li>
                                        <li>Your order will be highlighted in blue so you can easily spot it.</li>
                                        <li>The order book only displays the top 100 buy and sell orders. If your order is not in the top 100, it will not be displayed, but it will appear if enough orders trade.</li>
                                        <li>EtherDelta does not do order matching. For example, if someone is offering PLU for sale at a price of 0.03, and you place an order to buy for a price of 0.04, a trade will not automatically happen. The only way to make a trade happen is to click an order and trade it.</li>
                                        <li>Your balance will not change when you place an order. Your balance will only change when your order trades.</li>
                                        <li>EtherDelta checks to make sure each order is backed by an appropriate deposit, but it does not check to make sure the sum of each user's orders is backed by a deposit. If, when an order trades, it means other orders are no longer backed by an appropriate deposit, then those orders will disappear from the order book until more funds are added.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>How to cancel an order</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>In the lower middle of the screen, under "My Transactions," click the Orders tab.</li>
                                        <li>Find your order in the list of orders and press "Cancel."</li>
                                        <li>This will trigger a transaction.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <h2>How gas (transaction) fees work</h2>

                                    <p>Every Ethereum transaction involves a gas fee which is paid to miners on the Ethereum network. On EtherDelta, Ethereum transactions are required for depositing, withdrawing, and trading.</p>

                                    <p>If you're using EtherDelta with MetaMask, you can lower the gas price when you accept a transaction to pay a lower gas fee. We recommend a gas fee of 4 gwei if you don't mind waiting a few blocks for your transaction to confirm. If you're using EtherDelta without MetaMask, the gas price is fixed at 4 gwei.</p>

                                    <p>If you're not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the "Gas price" item in the account dropdown (upper right).</p>

                                    <p>Without getting into too much technical detail, a 4 gwei gas price corresponds to the following overall transaction fees:</p>

                                    <p>An important feature of EtherDelta is that placing an order doesn't involve an Ethereum transaction. Placing an order involves signing a message, which doesn't cost a gas fee. This means that placing an order on EtherDelta is completely free: there's no Ethereum transaction fee and there's no fee if the order trades. The one and only platform fee EtherDelta charges is a 0.3% fee paid by the person executing an order (paid in the instrument being sold).</p>

                                    <p>EtherDelta is a fully decentralized trading platform.</p>
                                    <p>This means you don't have to trust an administrator to hold your funds. Your funds are held in a smart contract in such a way that you and only you can deposit/withdraw/trade.</p>
<p>This also means that you have to deal with wallet software (or chrome plugins) every time you want to do anything on the trading platform (deposit, withdraw, trade). For first-time decentralized application (dapp) users, this can be quite frustrating.</p>
                                    <p>The UI (of wallet software and EtherDelta itself) will certainly improve in time, but for now there are some bumps in the road. If, as a first-time dapp user, this drives you to a centralized trading platform, this is certainly understandable. Just know that while your funds are parked at a centralized trading platform, there's a very high probability that one random morning you're going to wake up and find that your coins have disappeared (see Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, Cryptsy, etc.). With a decentralized trading platform, you don't have to worry about that. The choice is yours.</p>

                                    <h2>How to disable MetaMask</h2>

                                    <p>In case MetaMask has issues, you can always disable it and use EtherDelta's browser wallet. Here's how.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Go into MetaMask (orange fox icon in the upper right of Chrome) and click the three dots icon to get your private key. Paste it somewhere along with the address.</li>
                                        <li>Disable MetaMask (under Chrome’s Window -&gt; Extensions menu).</li>
                                        <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Forget account."</li>
                                        <li>Restart EtherDelta.</li>
                                        <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Import account." Enter your address and private key from MetaMask.</li>
                                        <li>Now you can use EtherDelta without MetaMask.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>How to enable MetaMask</p>

                                    <p>In case EtherDelta's browser wallet has issues (due to the Etherscan API being down), you can always use MetaMask. Here's how.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Install or re-enable MetaMask.</li>
                                        <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Export private key." Find a text editor and paste your address and private key there.</li>
                                        <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Forget account."</li>
                                        <li>If you just installed MetaMask, go into MetaMask's menu and choose "Import account." Import the private key you extracted from EtherDelta.</li>
                                        <li>Restart EtherDelta.</li>
                                        <li>If you already had MetaMask from before, your account should appear in the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right) automatically, and you should select it.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li>In the account dropdown (upper right), next to your account address is your wallet balance. If it's 0, you need to send some ETH to your wallet address. Do that before proceeding to the next step.</li>
                                <li>Now that you have some ETH in your wallet, you need to deposit from your wallet to the EtherDelta smart contract so that you can start trading.</li>
                                <li>In the upper left, there is a Balance panel. There are three columns, "Token," "Wallet," and "EtherDelta." The first column, "Token," will have a row for the token you're looking at and a row for ETH. The "Wallet" column shows the balance held in the account you have selected in the account dropdown. Notice that the balance shown in the ETH row under "Wallet" matches the balance shown in the account dropdown.</li>
                                <li>When you deposit, you will move funds from your "Wallet" to the EtherDelta exchange smart contract. To do this, enter the amount you want to deposit and press "Deposit." Don't deposit all of your ETH though. You need to leave some behind in your "Wallet" to cover gas fees. A good rule of thumb is to leave 0.05 ETH in your "Wallet" to cover gas fees for future transactions you will do (trading, depositing, withdrawing).</li>
                                <li>After you press the "Deposit" button, if you're using MetaMask you'll have a transaction to approve. You can reduce the gas price from the default (~21 gwei) to 4 gwei if you're willing to wait longer for your transaction to confirm but pay a lower fee. If you're not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the "Gas price" item in the account dropdown (upper right).</li>
                                <li>NOTE: If you are depositing a token (not ETH), depositing will involve two back-to-back transactions. The first one approves the EtherDelta smart contract to transfer the deposit on your behalf. The second one is the actual deposit. You must approve both.</li>
                                <li>After your transaction has been sent, EtherDelta will tell you that you generated a transaction. You can click the link to track your transaction on Etherscan.</li>
                                <li>Once your transaction confirms, you should see funds move from the "Wallet" column to the "EtherDelta" column.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Withdraw</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The Withdraw tab is the opposite of the Deposit tab. It will move funds from the "EtherDelta" column back to the "Wallet" column.</li>
                                <li>Remember that in order to withdraw, you need to pay a gas fee, and the gas fee comes from your "Wallet."</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Transfer</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>If you find yourself asking, "what if I want to move my funds to another Ethereum address?" then the Transfer tab is for you. The Deposit tab moves funds from your wallet to EtherDelta. The Withdraw tab moves funds from EtherDelta to your wallet. The Transfer tab moves funds from your wallet to another wallet address.</li>
                                <li>If you want to "withdraw to another Ethereum address," you need to withdraw and then transfer.</li>
                                <li>On the Transfer tab, the first box is the amount you want to transfer. The second box is the address you want to transfer to. By default, the address you want to transfer to is pre-filled in with your existing address. Overwrite this with another address of your choice and then press "Transfer."</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Summary</p>

                            <p>Deposit: "Wallet" --&gt; "EtherDelta"</p>

                        <h3>How to trade</h3>
                        <div class="question-block">

                            <p>This guide assumes you already have a working account and you have deposited to EtherDelta. This means you should have a balance in the "EtherDelta" column. You should also have some ETH in the "Wallet" column to pay for gas fees when you trade.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Pick a token to trade. This guide will assume you have chosen PLU.</li>
                                <li>Most tokens are listed in terms of ETH. For example, a price of 0.03 PLU/ETH means 1 PLU costs 0.03 ETH.</li>
                                <li>In the order book, there are green orders and red orders stacked on top of each other. Green orders are people who want to buy PLU. Red orders are people who want to sell PLU. If you want to buy PLU, you can click a red order. If you want to sell PLU, you can click a green order.</li>
                                <li>EtherDelta only allows you to match against one order per transaction. You can't do a "market buy" that trades against multiple orders at once.</li>
                                <li>Partial fills are allowed. For example, if there is an order to sell 100 PLU, you can click the order and choose to only trade 25 PLU, leaving 75 PLU behind for someone else to trade.</li>
                                <li>When you do a trade, a transaction will be generated.</li>
                                <li>If two people try to trade the same order at once, the first transaction to be confirmed will get the trade (unless both orders are partial fills).</li>
                                <li>A failed trade will show up as an error on Etherscan. No funds will be lost except the gas fee for the transaction.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <b>How to place an order</b>
                            <ol>
                                <li>If you don't want to trade immediately or don't like the prices you see in the order book, you can place your own order.</li>
                                <li>An order doesn't involve a transaction. It involves signing a message. This means there is no gas fee for placing an order.</li>
                                <li>On the order form, select the Buy tab or the Sell tab depending on whether you want to buy or sell the token.</li>
                                <li>Let's assume you want to buy PLU.</li>
                                <li>The first box is the amount of PLU you want to buy.</li>
                                <li>The second box is the PLU/ETH price.</li>
                                <li>The third box is the amount of ETH you will spend. This box will populate automatically so you can confirm that the price you entered makes sense.</li>
                                <li>The fourth box is the number of Ethereum blocks until your order automatically expires. The default, 10,000, is about two days. If you want your order to last forever, enter 1000000000, which corresponds to about 400 years.</li>
                                <li>After you submit the order, you should see two small green bubbles pop up in the lower right. The first one will say "You sent an order." The second one will say "Your order was received."</li>
                                <li>After your order was received, it can take about a minute for the order to appear in the order book.</li>
                                <li>Your order will be highlighted in blue so you can easily spot it.</li>
                                <li>The order book only displays the top 100 buy and sell orders. If your order is not in the top 100, it will not be displayed, but it will appear if enough orders trade.</li>
                                <li>EtherDelta does not do order matching. For example, if someone is offering PLU for sale at a price of 0.03, and you place an order to buy for a price of 0.04, a trade will not automatically happen. The only way to make a trade happen is to click an order and trade it.</li>
                                <li>Your balance will not change when you place an order. Your balance will only change when your order trades.</li>
                                <li>EtherDelta checks to make sure each order is backed by an appropriate deposit, but it does not check to make sure the sum of each user's orders is backed by a deposit. If, when an order trades, it means other orders are no longer backed by an appropriate deposit, then those orders will disappear from the order book until more funds are added.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>How to cancel an order</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In the lower middle of the screen, under "My Transactions," click the Orders tab.</li>
                                <li>Find your order in the list of orders and press "Cancel."</li>
                                <li>This will trigger a transaction.</li>

                        <h3>How gas (transaction) fees work</h3>
                        <div class="question-block">


                            <p>Every Ethereum transaction involves a gas fee which is paid to miners on the Ethereum network. On EtherDelta, Ethereum transactions are required for depositing, withdrawing, and trading.</p>

                            <p>If you're using EtherDelta with MetaMask, you can lower the gas price when you accept a transaction to pay a lower gas fee. We recommend a gas fee of 4 gwei if you don't mind waiting a few blocks for your transaction to confirm. If you're using EtherDelta without MetaMask, the gas price is fixed at 4 gwei.</p>

                            <p>If you're not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the "Gas price" item in the account dropdown (upper right).</p>

                            <p>Without getting into too much technical detail, a 4 gwei gas price corresponds to the following overall transaction fees:</p>

                            <p>An important feature of EtherDelta is that placing an order doesn't involve an Ethereum transaction. Placing an order involves signing a message, which doesn't cost a gas fee. This means that placing an order on EtherDelta is completely free: there's no Ethereum transaction fee and there's no fee if the order trades. The one and only platform fee EtherDelta charges is a 0.3% fee paid by the person executing an order (paid in the instrument being sold).</p>

                        <div class="question-block">
                            <p>EtherDelta is a fully decentralized trading platform.</p>
                            <p>This means you don't have to trust an administrator to hold your funds. Your funds are held in a smart contract in such a way that you and only you can deposit/withdraw/trade.</p>
                            <p>This also means that you have to deal with wallet software (or chrome plugins) every time you want to do anything on the trading platform (deposit, withdraw, trade). For first-time decentralized application (dapp) users, this can be quite frustrating.</p>
                            <p>The UI (of wallet software and EtherDelta itself) will certainly improve in time, but for now there are some bumps in the road. If, as a first-time dapp user, this drives you to a centralized trading platform, this is certainly understandable. Just know that while your funds are parked at a centralized trading platform, there's a very high probability that one random morning you're going to wake up and find that your coins have disappeared (see Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, Cryptsy, etc.). With a decentralized trading platform, you don't have to worry about that. The choice is yours.</p>

                        <h3>How to disable MetaMask</h3>
                        <div class="question-block">

                            <p>In case MetaMask has issues, you can always disable it and use EtherDelta's browser wallet. Here's how.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Go into MetaMask (orange fox icon in the upper right of Chrome) and click the three dots icon to get your private key. Paste it somewhere along with the address.</li>
                                <li>Disable MetaMask (under Chrome’s Window -&gt; Extensions menu).</li>
                                <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Forget account."</li>
                                <li>Restart EtherDelta.</li>
                                <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Import account." Enter your address and private key from MetaMask.</li>
                                <li>Now you can use EtherDelta without MetaMask.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>How to enable MetaMask</p>

                            <p>In case EtherDelta's browser wallet has issues (due to the Etherscan API being down), you can always use MetaMask. Here's how.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Install or re-enable MetaMask.</li>
                                <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Export private key." Find a text editor and paste your address and private key there.</li>
                                <li>In the EtherDelta account dropdown (upper right), select "Forget account."</li>
